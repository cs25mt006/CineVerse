In the prologue of the 1939 Astor Pictures revival of this film, Hart gives a moving eight-minute introduction-- the first and only time he appeared in a film accompanied by his striking voice."}, {"id": 383992, "title": "Wyatt Earp: Return to Tombstone", "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 12, "popularity": 2.415, "score_rank": 0.21403217208664618, "imdb_link": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111757", "poster_path": null, "overview": "Combining colorized footage from the television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (1955) with new scenes shot in Tombstone, Arizona, this film shows the return of the legendary former Marshal Wyatt Earp to his old stomping grounds.
