Unlike the miniseries, which was presented in four segments (each with opening and closing credits), the Epic is presented as a single segment. In January 2016, HBO aired the Epic in its uncut and uncensored format, later making it available on its streaming platforms. The HBO showing contained most of the known deleted scenes, thereby lengthening the runtime of the Epic from its video release to 423 minutes."}, {"id": 47931, "title": "Elite Squad: The Enemy Within", "vote_average": 7.812, "vote_count": 1706, "popularity": 28.655, "score_rank": 0.31133137827325075, "imdb_link": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1555149", "poster_path": "/89nThdmRxWYqglPRtJt1kZjP6UE.jpg", "overview": "After a bloody invasion of the BOPE in the High-Security Penitentiary Bangu 1 in Rio de Janeiro to control a rebellion of interns, the Lieutenant-Colonel Roberto Nascimento and the second in command Captain André Matias are accused by the Human Right Aids member Diogo Fraga of execution of prisoners.
