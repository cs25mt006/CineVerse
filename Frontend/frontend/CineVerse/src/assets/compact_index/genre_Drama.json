The Picture of Dorian Gray is an archetypal morality tale of a young man who purchases eternal youth at the expense of his soul after meeting Lord Henry, who explains that beauty and youth are fleeting. Dorian Gray embarks on a journey in which he doesn’t age, but a portrait of him does. Increasingly mad by the portrait’s maturation as his body remains gorgeous, but his life remains vacuous, Dorian Gray comes to regret his choice and takes acts to reverse it, propelling him to a bloody conclusion."}, {"id": 1247264, "title": "עומדים מהצד", "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.4, "score_rank": 0.3069144046496983, "imdb_link": "", "poster_path": "/sk97szCOzb0T7Yw1jMgv1u1P1Nr.jpg", "overview": ""}, {"id": 1246842, "title": "vulnerability & words", "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.4, "score_rank": 0.3069144046496983, "imdb_link": "", "poster_path": "/wBp8SrgV5v4ERp2GTuIWVQ7Cvg4.jpg", "overview": "-I think that I should be letting you know of what's been on my mind lately  -Let's hear it my love"}, {"id": 1167254, "title": "Coffin Screw", "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.4, "score_rank": 0.3069144046496983, "imdb_link": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28690325", "poster_path": "/docIYS7SFff91golb5yE2zKTXZ8.jpg", "overview": "After finding some relics in an open grave, two young siblings share an up-close experience with death at the cause of their own hand."}, {"id": 1167138, "title": "Glenda", "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.4, "score_rank": 0.3069144046496983, "imdb_link": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28696951", "poster_path": "/sEjuwXoOvjepf8EMjE2VgiWb6b.jpg", "overview": "The female robot Glenda reflects about her relationship with the ballet."}, {"id": 1167904, "title": "Besos y Fracasos", "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.4, "score_rank": 0.3069144046496983, "imdb_link": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28708666", "poster_path": "/f2eqgrNKh7WrBml2punWlkYyFb2.jpg", "overview": ""}, {"id": 1168896, "title": "CACOPHONY", "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.4, "score_rank": 0.3069144046496983, "imdb_link": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28755268", "poster_path": "/aEQOcVjTF1jpLMBpiAXwGYgSQck.jpg", "overview": "Three adrift artists wander around a college campus and its local sites as they struggle to engage with art and its creation."}, {"id": 1170305, "title": "Les Collégiens", "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.4, "score_rank": 0.3069144046496983, "imdb_link": "", "poster_path": "/etAmQCaLLO8DVgvuSU4OtDx9cCv.jpg", "overview": ""}, {"id": 1160009, "title": "Mi primer show", "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.4, "score_rank": 0.3069144046496983, "imdb_link": "", "poster_path": "/5mCMb2VEJRITQVOWnCB5P0yiZ59.jpg", "overview": ""}, {"id": 1189432, "title": "Nanoshot", "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.4, "score_rank": 0.3069144046496983, "imdb_link": "", "poster_path": null, "overview": "The nonlinear story of seeing a young woman, Alex, desperately explains why she doesn’t belong in police custody.
